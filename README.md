# Plant-Disease-Classifier-Web-App

Project Description:

The Plant Disease Classifier is an interactive web application that identifies diseases in plant leaves using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The project helps farmers, researchers, and plant enthusiasts quickly detect plant diseases from images, enabling timely action to prevent crop damage.

The CNN model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains thousands of images of healthy and diseased leaves from different plant species. Users can upload an image of a leaf, and the app preprocesses it, predicts the disease class, and displays the result in a user-friendly interface.

Features:
1. Image Upload
- Supports JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats.
- Handles images of varying sizes and automatically resizes them to match the CNN model input.

2. Image Preprocessing

- Resizes images to 224Ã—224 pixels.
- Normalizes pixel values to the [0, 1] range.
- Adds a batch dimension to make images compatible with the CNN model.

3. Disease Prediction
- Uses a trained CNN to predict probabilities for multiple classes of plant diseases.
- Selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted disease.
- Maps numeric class indices to human-readable class names using a JSON file.

4. Interactive Web Interface

- Built with Streamlit for a simple and responsive interface.
- Displays the uploaded image alongside the predicted class.
- Allows users to click a Classify button for instant predictions.

5. Multi-Class Classification Support
- Capable of predicting multiple diseases across various plant species.
- Trained on a diverse dataset to improve accuracy and robustness.
